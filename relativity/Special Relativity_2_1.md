He was is indisputably unique and yet ubiquitous. Surely the most recognizable representative of physics, ever. I mean, "Person of the Century"? Within your field of view right now are devices and modern-day conveniences that he invented or for which he laid the framework. Your reading on more than one. He also changed every branch of physics, and invented a couple of them. There's no ambiguity: his was the most imaginative and productive scientific career since Newton, in many ways broader in scope than Isaac's. 

> He was also a walking contradiction in many ways: a lover of mankind, yet indifferent and even cruel to individuals; a rebel in so many ways, yet so conservative that he left the mainstream of physics that he started; solitary and focussed to an almost superhuman degree, and yet fond of the limelight; practical in his scientific outlook, and yet a sophisticated student of Mozart, Kant, Hume, Spinoza, and Schopenhauer. An enigma. 

Stories and myths abound. That's probably no surprise. No. He didn't flunk math. He taught himself calculus while barely in high school. No. He didn't flunk anything. He read Kant at the age of 13! No, he was not religious. His family were secular Jews who sent him to a Catholic high school. When asked, he espoused the philosophy of Spinoza, which is the opposite of a deity-worshiping religion. 

Professional physicists find it hard to "own" Albert Einstein. You've met a few other folks in your experience so far (Newton, Huygens, and Maxwell, and a couple more to come, Dirac and Feynman) who can't be "followed" in the sense of learning to be like them. Their packages of creativity, imagination, ingenuity, practical skill, and productivity can't be learned or emulated. Their approaches were  unique. Almost beyond-human. I hope I've been able to demonstrate that so far. But this guy is off the charts.

So while we enjoy reading of their lives, it's hard to use someone like Einstein as an example of a typical scientist. There's no formula for being a Hank Aaron or Nadia Comaneci or Count Basie or Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart...or an Albert Einstein. They open worlds for us to work in, but they can't set an example for us to emulate. 

Because he's so important and because his life is so interesting, we'll cover Einstein over multiple lessons. I'll introduce him in this lesson and we'll follow him to his first academic appointment – a rocky road. Special Relativity will be the focus here, of course, but when we get to Quantum Mechanics I'll fill in some of the details that surround that part of his work. 

> In 1905, Albert Einstein had four ideas that changed the world. They all should have been Nobel Prizes, but weren't. In fact, that's a disaster story that we'll cover later. In 1905 he invented the idea of the particle nature of freely propagating light; he convincingly showed how to demonstrate that atoms exist – quickly confirmed, settling a two thousand year-old argument; in his PhD thesis, he showed how to determine the size of molecules; and he invented Special Relativity – changing our relationship with space, time, and energy. In one year. As a completely unknown 26 year old, without a Ph.D., working all alone outside of the physics community. He went from being less than a nobody to being such a threat to Nazi Germany, that he had to flee for his life. All because of his calculations. That's power.

He was born in 1879 to a stable, loving secular Jewish family in the city of Ulm, which is about 100 miles northeast of Zurich. His father, Hermann was a salesman and co-founded a feather-bed shop with cousins. Albert was born to him and Pauline on March 14, 1879. (We North American geeks all celebrate "Pi Day" on 3.14, but we physics geeks recognize that to be Einstein's birthday also. European geeks have to bend their way of displaying dates in order to join in the fun, since that's 14.3 to them.) The bed shop failed – one of the first of many business failures for Hermann – and the family moved to Munich, about 100 miles to the east where Hermann and his brother, Jakob, founded an electric firm which specialized in municipal electrification, a brand new technology. Hermann did the sales and Jakob, an engineer, the technical work and they had some success, providing light for the Munich Oktoberfest in 1885. By that time, Albert's devoted sister, Maria ("Maja") was four years old and Albert six.

They bet wrong. There was a large fight over whether power distribution should be Direct Current or Alternating Current. Maybe you've heard of the contentious battle between Thomas Edison and Nicola Tesla. Edison lost – he favored DC – and Tesla won – he championed AC. Hermann and Jakob lost the DC-AC battle also and their business folded when they were unable to convert their factory to AC and lost the contract to electrify the whole of Munich. They moved their factory to Pavia, Italy where it failed in 1896. The brothers split, and Hermann started another electrification factory in Milan which managed to hold together until Hermann died of a heart attack in 1902 at the age of 55.

Albert had not followed the family to Italy, but remained with relatives in Munich to attend a Catholic primary school. He was successful enough – often the top in his class – that students remember him helping them with their Catholic studies. When he was 9, he switched to a large, Munich high school which emphasized mathematics and science. While he was the only Jew in elementary school, there were enough Jews in high school that school officials organized Jewish religious studies for them – in Germany! As I mentioned, he didn't funk mathematics. He taught himself integral and differential calculus before he was 15 – which was the year his father's business in Pavia failed. His parents still regularly bought him advanced books which he devoured during summer vacations. 

During these years he began to form at least two personal traits. Bavaria was a regimented society and reverence for a militaristic outlook was a part of life. Not for this child. He rebelled internally, and rebelled outwardly in school against mindless rules. "A foolish faith in authority is the worst enemy of truth." His impudence showed and teachers either loved him or disliked him intently. And publicly. 

The other personal – even therapeutic – aspect of his life was the violin. From age 5 he and his mother would play Mozart duets and he would reach for his violin when stuck on a problem, proclaiming that he's solved it in the middle of a piece. (I can relate in a tiny way, and I suspect many of my friends can as well. I know that I solved problems in graduate school while I slept. But while I used unconsciousness, Albert used amazing powers of concentration and focus.) 

He might have been expelled from high school, or he left on his own. It's not clear, but he simply didn't return after Christmas vacation in 1894. Rather he appeared at his family's apartment in Italy proclaiming that he was done with Germany – military conscription was on the horizon for him and he managed to rid himself of his German citizenship. He worked in the family business and studied for entrance in to the Zurich Polytechnic, which was a technical college that would prepare physics students to teach in high schools or maybe go for an advanced degree elsewhere. The Polytechnic did not offer anything but a bachelor's degree. 

Here's where he failed. He was offered the opportunity to take the entrance exams – remember, without a high school diploma – and scored well above the necessary requirements in mathematics and physics, but did not meet the standards in literature, French, politics, and the other sciences. He was advised to find a tutor and to take them again in a year. 

That he did: when he was 16 he moved to Aarau and lived with the Winteler family led by Jost who taught history and Greek at the advanced, and rather liberal cantonal school. In the Winteler household, he found his first girl-friend, Marie, a newly trained teacher and 18 years old. He would eventually treat her badly, but his connections to that family were permanent. Marie's sister, Anna, would marry Einstein's best friend, Michael Besso (the only person mentioned in Einstein's 1905 relativity paper) and his sister, Maja, would marry Marie's brother, Paul.

<p class="caption">

By 1896, he completed his studies at Aarau with top marks (second in his class) and passed the entrance exams to the Polytechnic. In typical fashion, he arrived late for the entrance physics exam, but finished it early with the top score. So at the age of 17, he was finally going to the university.

> Think about his young life from the perspective of your own: separated from his parents to attend a Catholic elementary school as a young Jew; entered high school, but not bothering to graduate; as a 16 year old, moving to another country to prepare for the university; and eventually qualifying for entrance after failing once. Einstein never lacked for self confidence nor intensity.

What's worse than breaking up with your girlfriend using text? Why using her mother as the deliverer of the bad news. Soon after entering the university, Einstein wrote to Marie's mother that he wanted to end his relationship with Marie who did not quite get the hint in his increasingly cold, and then absent letters. Marie had a hard life, married, but divorced. She was often ill and died in a mental asylum in 1957.

### Mileva Mari

Remembering Marie Curie's experience in attending a university in Europe in the 1890s should give you the impression that women in college were not common, and not often welcome. In Einstein's entering class of 6 students at the Zurich Polytechnic there was a young Serbian woman. You should form the image of a strong, young person, far from home, but determined to obtain a tough degree.

<aside class="marginfigure">
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:huygens"></span>
<img src="./images/relativity/Mstudent.png" alt="Christiaan Huygens &lt;br&gt;1629-1695" width="500" />
<p class="caption">
Mileva Mari as a student at the Polytechnic.
</p>
</div>
</aside>

Mileva Mari was the daughter of a retired military officer in the army of the Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. She was bright and her father found ways to enroll her in increasingly rigorous, and unlikely, advanced mathematically-intense schools in her home town of Novi Sad, and then a neighboring city. She moved herself to Zurich (for her health, as she might have once had tuberculosis)  to finish high school in an all-girls academy, then she enrolled in the University of Zurich for a semester, and eventually transferred to the Polytechnic as a first-year student with Einstein, who was two years younger.

The "Mileva story" is complicated for a variety of reasons. She and Albert were friends during their first years, and that friendship turned into a tentative romance that first summer.  And, as a very independent person, their relationship worried her enough that she transferred to the University of Heidelberg for the next year to avoid him. But their separation didn't last and she returned, now committed to what became a serious romance.

While she bore a permanent limp, they took long mountain hikes and read physics together, alternating between their two student boarding houses. They seemed to revel in their "otherness" and bohemian outlook on life. She was intense and somewhat brooding, he was similar.  A match. Their correspondence was far from rebellious – it was sweet to annoyingly syrupy. "Soon I’ll be with my sweetheart again and can kiss her, hug her, make coffee with her, scold her, study with her, laugh with her, walk with her, chat with her, and ad infinitum!" "When I read Helmholtz for the first time I could not—and still cannot—believe that I was doing so without you sitting next to me. I enjoy working together and I find it soothing and also less boring." He called her Dollie and she called him Johnnie. Icky comes to mind. 

By the time they both finished their studies, Albert finished second from the bottom in his class where did very well in theoretical physics and mathematics but was mediocre in all of his other subjects, including the lowest score possible in experimental physics. Probably blowing up the lab and his outward disrespect to the professor in charge of experiment didn't help. Mileva scored at the bottom, of their class and tried two more times to take the final exams, but failed each one and was not allowed to graduate with a degree. 

> A senior research project was required of Polytechnic physics students. Here is where his years of insolence caught up with him. The professor in charge was Heinrich Weber, an expert in electromagnetism, but electromagnetism of the past. It was Weber who originally encouraged the 16 year old Einstein and admitted him to the school. But Weber's teaching and ignorance of anything resembling modern day physics insulted Albert...who started calling him "Herr Weber" rather than "Professor Weber." Eventually, after cutting classes around the curriculum and apparently insulting everyone in sight, the break was complete. 
> 
> Einstein proposed as his topic: a technique to measure the speed of the Earth relative to the ether that was almost exactly Michelson's experiment. Weber turned him down and told him that it had already been done. Two more proposals were required before they agreed on a topic. The end result was the second lowest project score in the class (Mileva's was the lowest)...and he made Einstein rewrite his – because he'd written his report on the wrong paper.

### What Unemployment Looks Like

So there they were in 1900. Albert with his teaching degree and no job. Mileva, without a degree. It was normal for a physics graduate to move on to another university for continuing studies [the Polytechnic would not offer PhD degrees until 1909, eventually becoming the very prestigious *Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule* (ETH)] or to stay as an assistant to one of the Polytechnic professors. 

Not only would no Polytechnic professor hire him, but Weber sent letters to other European professors warning them that Einstein was bad news. So he was effectively blackballed from employment or education in physics. For the next two years Einstein taught high school or tutored rich boys while peppering Europe with job applications. 

Then. Mileva became pregnant. For a while she lived alone in Zurich and then in a town near the village where he was a live-in tutor. Through much of her pregnancy, they lived apart, corresponding by mail.

This is where his pal Marcel Grossmann comes through. Grossmann was a brilliant mathematician, eventually, a professor mathematics at the ETH. Einstein regularly avoided classes and Marcel was both his friend and his academic resource. Grossmann's notes were apparently impressively complete and he'd loan them to Albert before examinations. Albert wrote to Grossmann's wife later, 

> "When it came time to prepare for my exams, he would always lend me those notebooks, and they were my savior. What I would have done without these books I would rather not speculate on." 

Grossman's father was influential and by chance, a friend of the Director of the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, the capitol. He recommended Einstein for an open position and after a lengthy back and forth, a job description was crafted to exactly match Einstein's credentials: a degree in physics and practical experience in electricity – from his summers working for his uncle Jakob. 

The couple was not married and Albert was not ready. It was hard on her and she was determined to have the baby.

> While pregnant in July 1901 Mileva tried for the last time to pass her exams and failed. During that episode Albert was on vacation in Milan with his parents. His mother loathed Mileva and he never told them of the pregnancy. When she failed, Mileva went home to tell her parents of her failure and of her pregnancy. Alone.

The patent office position became official in January of 1902, Einstein moved to Bern in anticipation – without Mileva, since as a Swiss civil servant, living with an unwed woman would have been disqualifying. Within days of his arrival, she gave birth to a healthy girl, Lieserl. In Serbia. 

Einstein never saw his daughter as Mileva returned to Switzerland without her in the fall of 1902 – to Zurich, not Bern. They eventually married in January of 1903 in a civil ceremony with only Einstein's two friends in attendance. Afterwards, they had dinner and later learned that Albert had locked them out of their apartment. 

Lieserl's existence was not known until it was discovered in 1987 correspondence. Her fate is unclear and there are two theories. One is that she died in September of 1903 of scarlet fever. The other is that she was adopted by one of Mileva's childhood friends to a life that is lost to history.

### Bern

Einstein's appointment was as Technical Expert Class 3 of the Federal Office for Intellectual Property. His experience with Jakob led him into patents that had electromagnetism as their basis. It was the perfect setup for him. 

> "I became accustomed to my work quite fast, and in a short time I was able to do a full day's work in only two or three hours. The remaining part of the day, I would work out my own ideas, which later, of course, became the Relativity Theory...Whenever anybody would come by, I would cram my notes into my desk drawer and pretend to work on my office work."

<p class="caption">

The Zytglogge is a 13th century clock tower that puts on an amazing performance every hour: dancing mechanical bears, a dancing jester, and a gold figure who turns an hourglass and opens his mouth at every gong. The clock is near the Bern train station and was for a century a central time-reference for Europe. The engineers would reset their clocks on board and then carry that time reference to their next destinations. Every hour, a crowd gathers to watch the spectacle. This was Einstein's muse, twice a day as he walked by. His and Milen's flat was just a few doors down on the left.

```

His day started at 8 AM and his walk from their apartment in the Medieval section of Bern took him past the 13th century famous clock tower near the original city wall. He spend 7 years at the Patent Office and was promoted once, when he completed his PhD by submitting a thesis to the University of Zurich in April of 1905. (In those times in Europe it was not necessary to be enrolled in a university to receive a PhD there...you could send a thesis to a professor who, if it was accepted, would lead to an examination and a degree. That's what he did.)

Let's summarize his life in a timeline. It's rather remarkable:

* July, 1900: graduates with his bachelor's degree in high school physics teaching from The Zurich Polytechnic. 
* 1900: Fails repeatedly to get a position at his alma mater as an assistant and berates one of the senior faculty for spreading unflattering gossip about him to other scientists in Europe from whom Einstein was trying to find a job.
* February, 1901: becomes Swiss citizen, fails his military service physical
* 1901: writes his first scientific paper.
* 1901-1902: works as a temporary teacher/tutor in Switzerland 
* 1902: Lieserl is born in Hungary, but is lost to history.
* June, 1902: Appointed as a Technical Expert Third Class at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern, Switzerland.
* January, 1903: Mileva and Albert marry in Bern.
* April, 1903: Albert and two friends establish their "Olympia Academy" for reading and discussing philosophy and science.
* May, 1904: Son, Hans Albert, born in Bern.
* 1905: That ridiculous year: 
  * March 17: Photoelectric effect paper, proposes quanta. (stay tuned)
  * May 11: Explains Brownian motion, quantitatively demonstrating the existence of atoms. (stay tuned)
  * July 20: Submits PhD thesis to University of Zurich, "A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions"
  * September 28: Special Relativity paper
  * November 21:  $E = mc^2$ paper
* January, 1906: Receives PhD from the University of Zurich.

### His 1905 Papers In Brief

* His first paper in March of 1905 took Planck's idea that heat radiation came in "corpuscles" through vibrations of a surface's atoms and extended it to the behavior of all electromagnetic phenomena. This is the invention of quantum mechanics and we'll discuss it in depth later.

* His second paper two months later proposed a way to confirm that molecules exist. In 1827 botanist Robert Brown was studying the odd, random motions of pollen grains suspended in water. Under a microscope, he found that they appeared to be jittery and would randomly move in an inefficient but coherent way. Of course his first guess was that the cause was a living organism, but subsequently it was found that inorganic material would do the same thing. This went unexplained for half a century. Until 1905.

  Suppose a group of kids are close together and batting a beach ball over their heads. Without an attempt to guide the ball in any particular direction, the ball would sort of randomly jerk in all directions. Einstein proposed that the random pollen motions represented the kicks that the pollen received when it bounced against the unseen water molecules. And, he could calculate in a statistical way, how far, in a given time, on average a pollen molecule would move. Jittering all the way, but making overall progress. With lots of molecules, his model led to a statistical prediction which measurements confirmed. He could even predict the value of Avogadro's' Number and the average size of the molecules.

* His PhD thesis, submitted two months after the Brownian motion paper, invented a way to calculate the size of sugar molecules dissolved in water. It  was the first time that this had been considered for liquids, since the new-fangled "kinetic theory" was predicated on the behavior of molecules in gasses. Avoiding the radical notions of his quantum paper, he was able to predict Avagadros' Number with only the inputs of the size of sugar molecules and the concentration of sugar. After some modifications in later years, his prediction was very accurate and became one of his most useful calculations.

* Then, two months later he submitted his Special Relativity paper, our concern in this lesson.

* Two months after that...his $E=mc^2$ paper (which he derived as $m=\dfrac{E}{c^2}$ ) was submitted.

### Mileva's Role

I mentioned earlier that Mileva's role is controversial. The issue is what was her participation in the development of Special Relativity, if any. He wrote lovingly four years prior about "our." In 1901, : "How happy and proud I will be when the two of us together will have brought our work on the relative motion to a conclusion!" It's clear from correspondence, that she probably helped him proof-read and check the mathematics. There was a, now refuted, story that she was a co-author on the original draft of the paper. 

There is no example in correspondence between them, or they with others that suggest that Mileva was a part of the development of the concepts of relativity. She never made those assertions, even through a contentious divorce. Their older son also indicated that while she worked with him, it was likely in a supportive role. Whole conferences and TV specials have been devoted to this subject and for some it's still an open question, but I think that the preponderance of the evidence is that Albert conceptualized and did the mathematics of Special Relativity and that Mileva helped him to make it coherent and be sure it was mathematically correct.

Let's take it apart.

## A Different Way Out: Einstein's Relativity Paper

Einstein had been committed to Maxwell's (and Faraday's) notion of a field from his earliest days and chose to take it seriously, every bit of it. Maxwell found that electromagnetic waves propagate at $c$ and nowhere mentioned (nor did his equations support) any other speed for light. Einstein took it as a postulate –where a mathematician starts without the need to defend–that Maxwell's $c$ was the case regardless of a frame of reference. That wasn't necessarily what Maxwell meant – he meant that light moved at that special value in the ether. Einstein took Maxwell's lack of concern about another reference frame as license to declare it constant regardless.

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">In his fourth revolutionary paper of 1905, Einstein proposed that the speed of light is special: it's a constant for all observers, regardless of their relative motion. </p>

The fancy phrase is that *the speed of light is an invariant*. That's quite a promotion for just a number and completely different from Maxwell and Lorentz's models.

But he was only just beginning. He was also offended by the realization from Lesson \@ref(maxwell) that Maxwell's Equations and Newton's laws of motion behave differently depending on an observer's state of motion. The way out of that was to make another declaration: a big expansion of Galileo's Relativity:

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">Einstein proposed that not only mechanical experiments are incapable of distinguishing relative states of motion, but that <em>all phenomena should be identically described by relatively moving obdservers</em>. </p>

These two ideas were declared by the young less-than-unknown Einstein to be the Postulates of Special Relativity:

1. The "**First Postulate**," what Einstein called the "Principle of Relativity." All laws of physics – mechanical and electromagnetic – are identical in co-moving, inertial frames of reference. That's taking Galileo seriously, and adding Maxwell.

2. The "**Second Postulate**." The speed of light, $c$ is the same for all inertial observers. That's taking Maxwell more seriously than even Maxwell took Maxwell seriously!

A couple of caveats:

* Einstein did not call his theory Special Relativity. That name came from Max Planck and Einstein didn't particularly like it. He preferred to call it the Invariant Theory since it hinged on the invariance of the speed of light. Can't always get what you want. So he and we always have to fight off the inclination to believe that "everything is relative." Nope.
* Can you see that the First Postulate is not consistent with the conclusions in Lesson \@ref(relativity1) We can't have it both ways–Newton and Maxwell both working the same between inertial frames – so something has to give. He took Maxwell seriously, and then had to worry about what that meant for the 200 years' worth of reliance on Newton's laws of motion. Stay tuned.

The title of this revolutionary work from this less-than-unknown scientist with only an undergraduate physics teaching degree is: 

> On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies

### Let's Read Some of Einstein's Paper

You can take in Einstein on this subject. He's precise and even pedantic and he asks questions that nobody else thought qualified as questions. Let's read exactly what Einstein wrote. Here's his first paragraph:

> It is known that Maxwell's electrodynamics—as usually understood at the present time—when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in the phenomena. Take, for example, the reciprocal electrodynamic action of a magnet and a conductor. The observable phenomenon here depends only on the relative motion of the conductor and the magnet, whereas the customary view draws a sharp distinction between the two cases in which either the one or the other of these bodies is in motion. 

<span class="newthought">
He's talking about our magnet-coil demonstration. Here's what he says happens: 
</span>

> For if the magnet is in motion and the conductor at rest, there arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet an electric field with a certain definite energy, producing a current at the places where parts of the conductor are situated. But if the magnet is stationary and the conductor in motion, no electric field arises in the neighbourhood of the magnet. In the conductor, however, we find an electromotive force, to which in itself there is no corresponding energy, but which gives rise—assuming equality of relative motion in the two cases discussed—to electric currents of the same path and intensity as those produced by the electric forces in the former case.

<span class="newthought">
This is exaclty what we discussed in the last lesson: the results of moving the magnet and moving the coil come about for entirely different reasons. 
</span>

The second paragraph is no less clear and he throws down the gauntlet in a battle that nobody else was willing to take on:

> Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the earth relatively to the “light medium,"... 

<span class="newthought">
He's implying that he knew of the Michelson Morley experiment, although later he confused the issue by saying that he didnt' and then that he did. He did.
</span>

> ...suggest that the phenomena of electrodynamics as well as of mechanics possess no properties corresponding to the idea of absolute rest. They suggest rather that, as has already been shown to the first order of small quantities, the same laws of electrodynamics and optics will be valid for all frames of reference for which the equations of mechanics hold good. 

<span class="newthought">
Here he's suggesting going beyond Galilean Relativity.
</span>

> We will raise this conjecture (the purport of which will hereafter be called the “Principle of Relativity”) to the status of a postulate, and also introduce another postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former, namely, that light is always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity c which is independent of the state of motion of the emitting body. 

<span class="newthought">
Here he's introduced his two postulates.
</span>

> These two postulates suffice for the attainment of a simple and consistent theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies based on Maxwell's theory for stationary bodies. 

<span class="newthought">
Maxwell, not Newton, is primary for this exercise.
</span>

> The introduction of a “luminiferous ether” will prove to be superfluous inasmuch as the view here to be developed will not require an “absolutely stationary space” provided with special properties, nor assign a velocity-vector to a point of the empty space in which electromagnetic processes take place.

<span class="newthought">
He just got rid of the ether because it’s “superfluous"...it's not necessary. It cannot be measured.
</span>

> The theory to be developed is based—like all electrodynamics—on the kinematics of the rigid body, since the assertions of any such theory have to do with the relationships between rigid bodies (systems of co-ordinates), clocks, and electromagnetic processes. Insufficient consideration of this circumstance lies at the root of the difficulties which the electrodynamics of moving bodies at present encounters.

<span class="newthought">
Here, the less-than-unknown Einstein has just said, “Hey. None of you – for centuries – have thought hard enough about this stuff.
</span>

Now he's going to insult the entire physics community by patiently trying to describe what it means to measure something.

> If we wish to describe the motion of a material point, we give the values of its co-ordinates as functions of the time. Now we must bear carefully in mind that a mathematical description of this kind has no physical meaning unless we are quite clear as to what we understand by “time.” 

<span class="newthought">
Seriously. He feels the need to tell everyone what we mean by the time of event.
</span>

> We have to take into account that all our judgments in which time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events. If, for instance, I say, “That train arrives here at 7 o'clock,” I mean something like this: “The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.”

> It might appear possible to overcome all the difficulties attending the definition of “time” by substituting “the position of the small hand of my watch” for “time.” And in fact such a definition is satisfactory when we are concerned with defining a time exclusively for the place where the watch is located; but it is no longer satisfactory when we have to connect in time series of events occurring at different places, or—what comes to the same thing—to evaluate the times of events occurring at places remote from the watch.

## What Was the Cause of That Storm? The Second Postulate's Implications

The Second Postulate plays havoc with my common sense, and I'll bet yours also. 

Einstein, more than anyone before him, set up experiments...but not in a laboratory. In his brain. He called them Thought Experiments...Gedankenexperiments. They're stories that stress the logic of a model if not the mathematics. While they might be hard to actually perform in reality, they stress-test a model for consistency and force conclusions that are sometimes (usually, from him) surprising. If you buy the model, then you're obligated logically to buy the conclusions. So here's our first one: baseball.

Let's look at the crafty Chicago Cubs pitcher, Kyle Hendricks. (Called The Professor due to his mathematically intense Economics degree from Dartmouth College.) Hendricks is not going to terrify any hitters with the velocity of his pitches, but he's not going to throw the ball into the strike zone either. 

He's known for his unusual training regime. For example training, on the train.

Here we see him pitching to Willson Contreras. On flatcars behind Wrigley Field. The ball leaves his hand at 80 mph. The Professor has some questions:

1. What is the speed of the ball that Contreras experiences?

   **Okay.** Isn’t it just 80 mph? <br>
   **Glad you asked.** Good. Of course.

![ball_2](./images/relativity/ball_2.png)

Now the pitcher's car is moving towards the catcher at 50 mph and he throws his standard, consistent pitch at 80 mph relative to his car. 

2. What is the speed of the ball now that Contreras experiences?

   **Okay.** Well, now the ball has both the speed of the pitchers throw plus the speed of the car that he’s riding on. The catcher is still staionary, so he sees $80+50=130$ mph. <br>
   **Glad you asked.** Yup. Makes sense, right?

![ball_3](./images/relativity/ball_3.png)

3. Now. The catcher's car is moving toward the pitcher's car which is still moving at 50 mph.

   **Okay.** Now this is silly. They’re going to collide. But before they do, the speed that the catcher would feel would be $80+50+25=155$ mph. <br>
   **Glad you asked.** Yes, that's right. Apart from the silliness, it's exactly what your common sense would suggest.

Now, Hendricks is just messing around, but I'll bet he took a course at Dartmouth (and I suspect I know the guy who taught him) that included Special Relativity. Instead of a baseball, he's pitching light. 

![light_1](./images/relativity/light_1.png)

4. What is the speed of the light beam that Contreras experiences if we're back to both cars being stationary with respect to the ground and one another?

   **Okay.** That’s easy. It’s $c$ <br>
   **Glad you asked.** Yes. Just like before.

![light_2](./images/relativity/light_2.png)

5. Now what's the speed of the light beam that the catcher experiences with Hendrick's car moving toward the catcher?

   **Wait.** I want to say that it’s $c+50$ mph. <br>
   **Glad you asked.** Good suggestion. But nope.

The Second Postulate says that regardless of observer's state of motion, light will always travel at the same speed:  $c=3 \times 10^8$ m/s = 186,000$ mph. That same number that Michelson measured over and over.

![light_3](./images/relativity/light_3.png)

6. Now. What would the speed of the light beam be that the catcher experienced?

   **Wait.** I want to say $c+50+25$ mph but I know you’ll go all “Second Postulate” on me. So I guess I have to say $c$. Which I don’t like. <br>
   **Glad you asked.** Neither do I. But you're right. According to Einstein's Second Postulate, the speed of the light beam is indeed $c$.

There are consequences to that Second Postulate. And that "storm" in his mind had to do with the whole idea of how to determine whether events determined to be simultaneous in one inertial frame of reference can be simultaneous in all inertial frames of reference. Because that's how you "tell the time" of an event.

Back to that remarkable paper:

> "Our judgments in which time plays a part are always judgments of simultaneous events,...If, for instance, I say, 'That train arrives here at 7 o’clock,' I mean something like this: 'The pointing of the small hand of my watch to 7 and the arrival of the train are simultaneous events.'"

Simultaneity. That's the storm.

### Simultaneity

Let's see what the Second Postulate says with the pitching exercise in mind. Another way of describing the odd result is that the light beam did not carry the motion of the source (the pitcher) with it when it made the trip between co-moving frames of reference. That speed was all to itself, independent of everything, and just plain....$c$.

Keeping our transportation metaphor in mind, let's do another Einstein-like thought experiment. Here's the situation:

* We have a fellow lounging on the ground next to a railroad track. "Track man."
* On a train car is "Train Lady" who has pre-assembled a set of physical circumstances:
  * She has rulers and clocks and a light source for measurement.
  * She lays out a line on her car from left to right and positions her self precisely at the center of the line. 
  * At the left and the right edges she's created light-detectors that can record the time of arrival of a light beam. She needed her light source to set this up so that they are synchronized, like described in Lesson \@ref(relativity1).
  * She's also got a light bulb with her at the center that when she pushes a button, will send out a spherical light front that will then eventually hit her light detectors.
* The thought experiment has two phases:
  - The train car is stationary with respect to the ground, so both Train Lady and Track Man are stationary relative to one another. When she pushes the button what do both of them see the light detectors register?
  - Now the train car moves from left to right at a constant speed. When Train Lady passes in front Track Man, a switch is thrown and the light beam is started from her bulb. This establishes the origin of time that both of them would agree to: $t_{\text{Train Lady}}=t_{\text{Track Man}}=0$. What do both of them see the light detectors register?
	
  Let's see what happens.

<video width="500" poster="./images/relativity/train_cover.png" controls>
  <source src="./images/relativity/train_simultaneous.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center>
Because of the Second Postulate:

* The light beam does not carry the motion of the train car with it: both observers see light traveling at $c$.
* Train Lady says that the light beams hit her detectors at the same time: they are simultaneous in her frame.
* Track Man says that the light beam hits her left detector before her right detector: they are not simultaneous in his frame.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:huygenssaturn"></span>
<img src="./images/relativity/phone.png" alt="CAPTION" width="300" />
</div>

Isn't this a little strange?

Einstein interpreted the consequence of this thought experiment–remember, having to accept the result if the model's logic is sound–as requiring that the whole concept of **Simultaneity** does not exist.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:huygenssaturn"></span>
<img src="./images/relativity/grave.png" alt="CAPTION" width="400" />
<p class="caption">
There is no such concept as Simulteneity between co-moving, inertial reference frames. 
</p>
</div>

That means that we've got a problem. Two of them, potentially:

1. Since there is no way to determined that an event is simultaneous in one frame and also in another:
   1. One can never synchronize clocks between co-moving, inertial frames of reference – remember his pedantic description of the watch statement above.
   2. So one can never determine the privileged position of any frame being absolutely at rest or a special frame of reference
2. The notion that a *cause* always precedes an *effect* seems threatened by this.

Remember the movie *The Curious Case of Benjamin Button*? Time seemed to go wrong for him. If there is a frame of reference in which A follows B but that sequence can be altered by moving relative to that frame...then could you find a frame in which B appears to a relatively moving observer to follow A?

What if A physically causes B! Now we have a problem for physics since effects really need to come after causes and this simultaneity exercise seems to threaten the very idea of causality. 

## Queue: The Soapbox.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center"><span id="fig:huygenssaturn"></span>
<img src="./images/relativity/soap.png" alt="CAPTION" width="200" />
</div>

It wasn't only because of Einstein...a revolt against German Idealism was already in the air in Europe, eventually centering in Vienna. But when Einstein said that the ether was "superfluous" he was enunciating an important criterion for what we can declare as scientifically knowable and what is not. 

In a nutshell, his observation that there is no way to experimentally determine whether an ether exists (as an absolutely stationary rest frame)  meant that it was meaningless to assert that it did. That's our criterion now:

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">An assertion about nature that is in principle unmeasurable is unscientific. </p>

This assertion is a close cousin to the famous idea of Karl Popper that the aim of science is to only disconfirm theories, not to confirm them. None of us accept that as a guide because we simply don't work that way. But here too, there's a whiff of an important point. Here's my take on this:

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">Every scientific theory can be refuted and every scientist can describe what evidence would be required in order to disconfirm his or her favorite theory. </p>

> If I would never, ever accept that Theory X or Belief Y can be showed to be wrong, then neither Theory X nor Belief Y is scientific. If you want to test someone's behavior as unscientific, **ask them to tell you what it would take to change their mind.** If they cannot come up with any circumstance that would convince them that their previous commitment was incorrect, then they're not being scientific. That's why Evolution belongs in the science curriculum, but Creationism does not.

By the way, we do accept and often strive to confirm theories, or more appropriately, models all the time. But confirmation comes with contingency: there are highly trusted confirmations, either because of the weight of the evidence or the long-standing, repeated success of the evidence. Popper was wrong about that.

Now I'll gently step down from my soapbox and get back to work.

## Double Down on the Second Postulate

There will be consequences! Here's a thought-device. A and D are light detection instruments–notice that there are meter sticks enforcing that they are the same distance from the center, C and F are time measuring instruments, and B and E are the connections of the detectors to the time measuring devices. The are both connected by identical, same-length cables. 

![light_device](./images/relativity/light_device.png)

If a beam of light travels from A to D the time that A and D detect the beam can be determined by C and F and knowing the distance between A and D, the speed of light can be measured:

![measuring_light](./images/relativity/measuring_light.png)

Notice that F has registered the finite time that the light took to go from A to D.

Now let's build two setups, one for Couch People and one for Sidewalk Guy back at the airport.

![devices_airport](./images/relativity/devices_airport.png)

And we'll fix a light source in the airpot and shine it down the concourse so that it intercepts both instruments, the on moving with Sidewalk Guy and the one beside the sidewalk in the Home frame with Couch People.

What do the two devices determine for the speed of light in those two apparently different frames of reference?

By now you know: 

* Sidewalk Guy's instrument would record: $c$
* Couch People's instrument would also record: $c$

Strange, isn't it. Obviously, I wouldn't have led you this far if there wasn't overwhelming support – dare I say, confirmation – that this bizarre situation isn't exactly what nature does. Before I get to the evidence, let's work out what some of the practical ramifications are by specifically following the Second Postulate – that absolutely invariant quantity of $c$ – to it's forced conclusions. In the rest of this lesson we'll consider:

* The behavior of inertial co-moving clocks
* The behavior of inertial co-moving meter sticks

In the subsequent lessons we'll add to this by considering:

* The behavior of speeds in an away frame as determined by co-moving, inertial observers
* The consequences for space travel
* The consequences for what energy is (the T-shirt equation)

## Time Dilation

Let's build a light clock. Anything that has a regular time "beat" can be a clock, we're going to use light beams that bounce around between mirrors. 

The premise is this:

* A light pulse is inserted through a hole at the bottom of...of course...a flatbed train car. No apples.
* There are two perfect mirrors at the top and the bottom which are separated by a distance, $L$
* The beams bounce back and forth in this view, which is that of the frame of reference of the train...we'll call it $A$ because you know what's coming.
  - So up is tick, and back down, is tock. A very accurate clock.

But it's a train and trains move and so does this one to the right at a velocity $u$. And, of course we have a guy lounging on a couch and he's watching the whole thing go by. What does someone riding on the train see? Exactly the same thing at each increment of time: what' shown in the above picture. A perfectly vertical path of the light back and forth. Tick tock.

Here it is as viewed from the train, the Away frame.

![lightclock_A](./images/relativity/lightclock_A.png)

```{r tag, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center", fig.cap="CAPTION", dev='png', out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics('./images/relativity/lightclock_A.png')
```

What does Couch Guy see? The train is moving and so when tick happens, it's moved to the right a bit from the laser-pointer insertion. When tock happens, it's moved a little further. So if Couch guy maps out the trajectory of the light pulses from his $H$ frame, he'd see this:

![lightclock_H](./images/relativity/lightclock_H.png)

The path of the light for him is a triangle. 

The Second Postulate makes this simple situation become weird. And this is an important conclusion and it's so subtle that it's worth following it carefully

<center>
<video width="500" poster="./images/relativity/lightclock_H.png" controls>
  <source src="./images/relativity/lighclock_reduced.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
</center>

In fact, this is an Pop-Up assignment that you'll receive instructions for during the class. It's to follow along with this simple, but enlightening derivation and turn in your version of it.

### Spoiler: Time Dilation

If you've not been through the movie (why not?) then this is a spoiler alert! The calculation follows the two paths of light, the tick tock, up and down in the $A$ frame and the tick tock in the longer, triangular path in the $H$ frame. The distances traveled are different – $L$ for the $A$ frame and the hypothenuse of the triangle of which one leg has a length $L$ as observed in the $H$ frame. 

We can solve for the speed of light during a tick tock (actually, in the video, just a tick) which is simply the distance traveled divided by the speed. 

We pretend for the moment that the speed of light in the Home frame and the Away frame are different ($c_H \text{ & } c_A$) and we worked to solve for the two "tick" times from both frames:

* $u$ is the relative speed between the train and the ground, $A$ and $H$
* $c_A=\dfrac{L}{t_A}$ and 
* $c_H=\dfrac{\ell}{t_H}$

By invoking the Second Postulate:
$$
c_H = c_A = c \nonumber
$$
we found that the tick from the tick-tock of the Home frame and the tick from the tick-tock of the Away frame are different! From the video clip, you can see that it's the Second Postulate that causes this to happen.

We found that: 
$$
t_H = \frac{t_A}{\sqrt{1-\left(\dfrac{u}{c}\right)^2}}. (\#eq:timeD)
$$
This root-factor will appear over and over in relativity and so it gets a special name, $\gamma$, and is called the "relativistic gamma":
$$
\gamma =\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\dfrac{u}{c}\right)^2}}.(\#eq:gamma)
$$
Furthermore, the frame speed compared with the speed of light also appears over and over and it gets its own name, "beta":
$$
\beta = \dfrac{u}{c}. (\#eq:beta)
$$
So with that we can recast our two formulae as:
$$
\begin{align*}
t_H =& \frac{t_A}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}} \\
t_H =&\gamma t_A
\end{align*}
$$
Now let's think about this. First, look carefully at $\gamma$. Notice that
$$
\text{if } \dfrac{u}{c}=\beta=0 \text{ then } \gamma = 1. \nonumber
$$
And:
$$
\text{if } \gamma = 1 \text{ then } t_H = t_A. \nonumber
$$
Can you see that this is the same thing as the train sitting still relative to Couch Guy? The clocks would both report the same times since they're both in the same reference frame.

Is $\gamma$ bigger or smaller than 1?

Well, $u/c <1$ (why will come later) so $\beta$ is a number that always is between $0$ and $1$. So...$(1-\beta^2)$ is a number that's always less than one and so:
$$
\gamma >1 \nonumber
$$

Let's plot it as a function of $u$ or more easily and generally, as a function of $\beta$:

![gamma](./images/relativity/gamma.png)

Look at the extremes: when $u$ is very close to the speed of light, $\gamma$ is growing very large, without bound, very fast. When $\beta=1$, then $\gamma \to \infty$! Maybe $\beta$ should never reach the speed of light? Stay tuned.

If we look at the low-$\beta$ end of the $\gamma$ curve, 

![gamma_small](./images/relativity/gamma_small.png)

we see that the deviation from $\gamma=1$ is very slow. At, say $\beta=0.1$ $\gamma$ is barely 0.05. 

Let's get a feel for just how fast $\beta=0.1$ is. That's 10% of the speed of light, or $3\times 10^7$ m/s: 
$$
\begin{align*}
&\text{MKS units:} \\ \\
c=& 300,000,000 \text{ m/s} \\
0.1c \approx& 30 \text{ million m/s} \\ \\
&\text{US units:} \\ \\
c=& 676,000,000 \text{ mph} \\
0.1c \approx& 70 \text{ million mph}
\end{align*}
$$

The fastest human-made object at this time is the Parker Solar Probe: which is headed towards the sun at 213,200 mph, or  about 95,310 m/s – what’s its beta?
$$
\beta = \frac{u}{c} = \frac{9.5 \times 10^4}{3 \times 10^8}=3.2 \times 10^{-4} = 0.00032
$$
What's its gamma? Inside of the width of the line of the plot:

![gamma_probe](./images/relativity/gamma_probe.png)

Can you see now that for anything like a human speed, $\beta$ is so close to 0 as to be silly to contemplate in everyday life.

In general, though, the two times are different for co-moving frames of reference and it matters in nuclear physics, in particle physics, in astrophysics, and in...well, your grandparents' TV, your GPS system, and in a number of modern devices. But driving on the highway or flying in an airplane? Notsomuch.

### What Does Time Dilation Mean?

Let's distinguish between two important concepts – really common sense, but in the Einstein-way of being precise about the meanings of simple things.

* An **event** is something that happens at a particular place at a particular time. If the train car had a firecracker at a particular place on the car and it exploded while the car was in motion relative to the ground, then both observers could note the position in their frames and the time in their frames at which the explosion **event** occurred.
* An **interval** is the difference between two positions in space and time during which two events occur. In the firecracker example, if Moe lights the fuse of the firecracker, that's one event and the explosion is then a second event and the space and time differences, which I'll often note as $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$, are the space and time **intervals**.

Often, we can define the first event in an interval as the beginning of a time interval, so to be boringly pedantic: $\Delta t = t-t_0 = t - 0 = t$ if we define the initial time (when you push the start button on your stopwatch) to be zero, $t_0=0$. 

Here's an example which involves an apple. Let's string a series of time snapshots together top, to bottom as time increases, top to bottom.

1. An Away frame with an apple advances to the right relative to our Home frame.


![apple_1](./images/relativity/apple_1.png)

2. At a particular point, the apple approaches its last moment of being whole...

![apple_2](./images/relativity/apple_2.png)

3. ...because 1 second later, a bite happens.

![apple_3](./images/relativity/apple_3.png)

4. And the lighter apple continues on its way.

![apple_4](./images/relativity/apple_4.png)

So, we have an interval at one moment it's whole, and then a second later, it's lost a bite.

![apple_5](./images/relativity/apple_5.png)

Think of this as sitting beside the tracks and as the train emerges from a tunnel (starting the stopwatch), watching a passenger take a bite out of her apple (halting the stopwatch).

So here, 

* $\Delta t_A = 1 $ second which we can call just $t_A$ since the stopwatch starts at $t_A=0$.
* The train is moving right along at 90% of the speed of light.
* What's $\Delta t_H$? How long did it take for the passenger to take that bite after emerging from the tunnel as observed by, say, creepy Couch Guy?

What **Time Dilation** says is this:
$$
\Delta t_H = \gamma \Delta t_A \nonumber
$$
We can use the plot of the relativistic gamma function to find what $\gamma$ is for this train frame.

![apple_gamma](./images/relativity/apple_gamma.png)

I think it's about $\gamma=2.3$.

So while the apple-consumer sees her clock advance by 1 second, Couch Guy sees his clock advance by 2.3 seconds. 

Let's get this clear in our heads. 

![HA_clocks](./images/relativity/HA_clocks.png)

While the $A$ clock has ticked off 1 second, the $H$ clock took 2.3 seconds to advance for the same interval. 

* Away clocks appear to a Home frame to run slower. It appears for an interval of time to take longer.

This is why its called Time Dilation: when your eyes are dilated at the Optometrist's office, they've become wider, more expanded.

This has an immediate effect in particle and nuclear physics. Many nuclei and elementary particles have finite lifetimes. We'll talk a lot about this later, but it's sufficient to imagine that a now-you-see-it-now-you-don't aspect is at work for many pieces of elementary nature. Take the lowly neutron. Put a neutron on the table (in your mind) and let it sit there minding its own business...eventually it will suddenly cease to be a neutron and become a proton, along with an electron and a pesky particle called a neutrino. If you put 100 neutrons on the table after about 10 seconds, on average there will be 50 neutrons and 50 protons on the table. After another 10 seconds, there will be 25 neutrons and 75 protons on the table. The half life of a free neutron is 10.2 seconds. That's an average. 

Now suppose that our 100 neutrons are whizzing by you at 90% of the speed of light and you follow them, then it will take $10.2 \times 2.3 = 23.5$ seconds for half of those neutrons to have decayed. In the neutron's (Away) frame, they appear to last 10 seconds, but in the laboratory (Home) frame, they live longer. 

This is a very real technique in particle and nuclear physics, used all the time artificially and naturally in nature. We'll have more to say about this.

There's more evidence that this is a real thing. In 1971, Joseph C. Hafele, a physicist, and Richard E. Keating, an astronomer took four atomic clocks (Cesium) and put two of them on a regular commercial airliner and two of them at United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C. Then they flew around the world, once eastward and once westward...and compared the clocks when they returned. 

![around_the_world](./images/relativity/around_the_world.png)

The clocks differed by exactly what Time Dilation would predict. We'll talk more about this later because the fact that the Home clocks were on the surface of the Earth and the Away clocks were five miles above called into play not only Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity, but also his General Relativity theory that involves gravitation. Both were required to get the differences expected.

Time Dilation is a fact of nature for all kinds of clocks: mechanical clocks, atomic clocks, elementary particle decays, and biological clocks. Think about that last one. You age according to natural processes of decay and rejuvenation. You heart beats. Your synapses fire at intervals governed by bio-electric impulses. Your cells age and die and are remade. You're a clock. 

Two points:

1. The time interval between two events measured in the frame in which they happen *at the same place*, but at different times, is a special time. It's the situation of our light clock in the frame of the train. As I've mentioned, this special time is called "proper time" and it's actually the shortest time that any interval might have as viewed from any frame. It's often given the name, $\tau$ and the frame of reference within which it's operative is called the Proper Frame.
2. Moe and Ossie are in two different, co-moving frames of reference and they both have strobe lights manufactured identically. So they would each measure in their own frames, the same proper time interval between each flash. But because of Time Dilation, if Moe is watching Ossie go by, he'd say that Ossie's strobe is slower than his. At the same time, Ossie is watching Moe go by in the other direction and *he'd also say* that Moe's strobe is going slower! Who is right? They both are.

> **Wait.** Hold the phone. They would both say tha thte other’s clock is running slow? <br>
> **Glad you asked.** Yes. If they didn't, then one would be able to distinguish one frame from the other, but that would violate the First Principle. Both frames are equally valid and are reciprocal in their adjudication of time intervals.

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">Time is relative between two co-moving, intertial frames of reference. </p>

This leads to the famous Twin Paradox, which is one of a number of "paradoxes" involving Special Relativity. 

> The so-called paradoxes of Special Relativity are really not paradoxical. They're circumstances that seem to be not possible – according to your common sense – but when analyzed strictly from within the rules of Relativity, turn out to be the case and internally consistent within the theory.

### Twin "Paradox"

Herman and Blanche are twins, one of whom is adventurous and the other of whom is a home-body. Blanche is eager for space travel and blasts off from Florida in a fancy spaceship that travels at half the speed of light. In the Home frame – Earth, where Herman resides – Blanche has been gone for 20 years and comes home. They find upon reuniting that Blanche has aged 17.3 years, while Herman has aged 20 years.

This is called the Twin Paradox, and like the other paradoxes of Special Relativity, it's not a paradox at all. But it is strange.

> **Wait.** Wouldn't you think the Blanche (in the spaceship) would see Herman (on Earth) flying away from her at half the speed of light and so upon reuniting wouldn't she be older, rather than younger? Isn't that a contradiction?<br>**Glad you asked.** That's a great question and is in line with decades of both misunderstanding and just plain wrong explanations. Let me explain without equations.

Notice that Herman's Home frame never deviates course. He remains in one frame for the entirety of their separation. What about Blanche?

She travels in one direction away from Earth and her brother for 8.6 years (half of that 17.3 years from above) at $u=0.5c$  in her frame. When it's time for her to go back to Earth, she has to *catch up* with Earth, which has been separating for that time. So she must travel back at $0.8c$ in order to catch up. 

So Blanche actually occupies two entirely different reference frames, while Herman never deviates from the single, boring Earth reference frame. So the two situations are not symmetric at all. (Sometimes an attempt to explain this sticks in the obvious, but irrelevant observation that in order to speed up and slow down multiple times in her trip, Blanche's journey is not describable using Special Relativity alone. Because accelerating frames are involved. That's not the explanation at all.)

## Length Contraction

The hallmark of the Second Postulate is that the speed of light is constant for all inertial observers. Since a speed is a length divided by a time and if time intervals are not invariant, then maybe space intervals as observed by different observers might be odd as well. That's in fact the case.

Without going into the more gritty details, we can reason our way to the next odd result predicted by Einstein's 1905 paper. Here's the result. Let's imagine a length, $L_A$–say a meter stick–on that, now famous train...the Away frame. Then Couch Guy alongside the tracks would measure a length, $L_H$ to be: 
$$
L_H = \frac{L_A}{\gamma}.(\#eq:name)
$$
Since $\gamma \>1$ then the Home frame would see lengths to be shorter than measured in the Away frame. Times longer, and lengths shorter. It's a strange universe.

This is called **Length Contraction**. Here's what the airport folks would see incorporating both of our strange relativistic behaviors: Traveler Man appears to Couch People to be shrunk along the direction of motion with a clock that they claim runs slower than Traveler Guy would claim.

## Let's Summarize

Let's summarize what the Second Postulate has mandated about space and time. Each makes use of two frames of reference which are moving relative to one another at a constant speed: inertial frames of reference. Observers are positioned in each frame equipped with rulers and clocks with which they can determine lengths and time intervals in their and the other frame. 

1. Events which are simultaneous in one frame, will not be simultaneous in the other. 
   2. This means that the two observers cannot synchronize clocks between their two frames. 
   3. This means that no frame is distinguished from the other in any way – so that there cannot be a privileged frame of reference as implied by the idea of the ether.

2. A clock in the Away frame will appear to run slower as viewed by the Home frame. This is called Time Dilation.
   2. This is reciprocal between the two frames since each observer would think of themselves are being in their own Home frame and the other an identically moving Away frame.
3. A length in the Away frame will appear to be shorter as viewed by the Home frame. This is called Length Contraction.
   4. Just like Time Dilation, Length Contraction is reciprocal between Home(s) and Away(s).

## Is Relativity the Case?

My friends from particle physics and I use Special Relativity as a tool, so I trust it quite a bit (although there's a story there which I'll tell you at the end of this lesson). But while there were a number of tests that seemed to confirm Relativity, there was one classic experiment in 1963 that puts our conclusions on full display. Let's go to New Hampshire.

### A Bit of the Particle Physics Zoo

This is my rendition of an electron. It's a familiar particle, responsible for the chemistry of all of the members of the periodic table and, as it turns out, is a very light object. It has an electrical charge of $-e$ and perhaps somewhat confusingly, we also refer to it by its nickname, $e$. It has a mass of that's less than 0.1% of that of the proton. We'll have a lot more to say about this particular particle and its cousins.

![electron](./images/relativity/electron.png)

And, here is a cartoon of one of those cousins, another particle called the muon. 

![muon](./images/relativity/muon.png)

This particular object came as a big surprise in the 1940's. It was unpredicted and unwelcome and ushered in an era in which surprises became the norm. 

The muon goes by the nickname, $\mu$, and has an electric charge of $-e$, just like the electron. In fact, the muon is *in every day identical to the electron*, except that it's much heavier: $m_\mu = 207 \times m_e$ and about 10% of the mass of a proton. 

But one thing about quantum mechanical particles is that they are not long for this world. If there are particles lighter, then heavy particles typically decay into the lighter ones and that's the case for the muon. In about a microsecond and a half, it decays into an electron (and two neutrinos, stay tuned).

![muon_decay](./images/relativity/muon_decay.png)

One other particle player, another particle surprise in the same experiment that found the muon, is the pion, aka $\pi$, which comes as both an electrically charged version and a neutral version. The pion's mass is about the same as the muon's mass...but a smidgen (that's a technical term) heavier. So...yup. It decays also into...maybe you know now, a muon. 	

![pion_decay](./images/relativity/pion_decay.png)

That's enough for a story.

### Cosmic Ray Showers

We're under attack all of the time from above. There are rogue protons barreling through the solar system that randomly bombard our upper atmosphere and undergo staggeringly energetic collisions with the Nitrogen atoms that make up the vast bulk of our air. These collisions produce billions and billions of particles about a third of which become pions and in flight, undergo that chain of decay.  Here's an animation:

  <source src="./images/relativity/relativity_lesson_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">

</center>

Remember that the muon has a lifetime of about 1.5 microseconds. That's its half-life and so its likelihood of decaying on average is 50% after 1.5 $\mu$s. So here's the question:

> How far would a muon travel on average if it is traveling at the speed of light if its half-life is 1.5 microseconds?

This is a simple calculation akin to any constant speed process, so that distance is:
$$
L=v \times t = c \times t = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s} \times 1.5 \times 10^{-6} \text{ s} = 450 \text{ m} \nonumber
$$
From the animation above, maybe you can see that the muons are produced at a height of about 30,000 m above the Earth, so the "number of lifetimes" that any muon would survive all the way to the surface of the Earth before decaying into electrons is about $30,000/450 = 67$. That corresponds to a probability of survival of about 0.00000000000000000000000000011. No muon should make it to the Earth, and yet we're constantly bombarded by muons. About every second, a muon goes through your thumbnail...and every other square centimeter of your body. Day and night, all of your life.

> **Wait.** How can this be? If they all should have decayed we shouldn’t be hit by any muons! <br>**Glad you asked.** That's right. But who's Away and who's Home in the muon's world?

As an example, rather than our quick calculation of the muon traveling at $c$ (which is not possible since it has a mass...stay tuned), let's make it a little more realistic and assume that our average muon travels at 90% of the speed of light. So $\beta=0.99$. 

Let's think about the Earth as the Home frame. There we see the muon in the Away frame, with an internal clock–its lifetime of 1.5 microseconds– dilated to something much longer. The $\gamma$ plot suggests to me that factor is just about 8:
$$
\begin{align*}
T_H =& \gamma T_A = 8 \times 1.5 \times 10^{-6} = 12 \times 10^{-6} \text{ seconds}
\end{align*}
$$

So the muons would be almost an order of magnitude more likely to reach Earth. [Truth time: The decay is actually an exponential with the time, $N(t) = N_0 e^{-T_Ht}$.]

 So we have two possibilities: 

1. The decay of muons according to the space and time physics of Newton and Co.
2. The decay of muons according to Special Relativity, featuring the dilation of the clock of the muon lifetime.

The situation was resolved in 1962 in the : experimenters D. H. Frisch and J. H. Smith went to a lab at the top of Mount Washington in the White Mountain National Forrest in New Hampshire, which is about 2000 feet above its base. This mountain is notorious for terrible weather with wind speeds of more than 100 mph. One doesn't learn how to do experiments under these conditions in graduate school!

![washington](./images/relativity/washington.png)

By measuring the number of muons that hit the top of the mountain and with identical equipment, measuring the number at then base of the mountain they compared the loss from top to bottom with what one would expect from Newtonian time to Relativistic time. 

This graph shows their result compared with a simple calculation imagining that 100 muons went past the peak. Basically, if Newtonian time were how our world worked, we should expect that most of the muons that are around at the top of the mountain would have decayed by the surface...about 5 out of 100 would survive. But if Time Dilation is the case, then about 60 muons out of 100 would survive and that's what they measured.

This is one of the first confirmations of Time Dilation, which is now just a tool in our particle and nuclear physics toolbox. We don't do experiments to confirm Special Relativity now...we trust it and we use it.

Now that we're messing with Space and Time, let's dig deeper into the First Postulate and we'll go back to the airport.
