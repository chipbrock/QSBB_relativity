</aside>
Look at the picture of this kindly gentleman. It's a picture of Hendrik Lorentz taken Cornell University. The universal accounts of Lorentz match the image that this photograph projects: a nice man. A father figure – indeed, Einstein viewed him as such. This mild-mannered Lion was the King of Electrodynamics and the acknowledged leader of theoretical physics until his death.

> "At the turn of the century, H. A. Lorentz was regarded by theoretical physicists of all nations as the leading spirit; and this with the fullest justification. No longer, however, do physicists of the younger generation fully realise, as a rule, the determinant part which H. A. Lorentz played in the formation of the basic principles of theoretical physics. The reason for this curious fact is that they have absorbed Lorentz’ fundamental ideas so completely that they are hardly able to realise to the full the boldness of these ideas, and the simplification which they brought into the foundations of the science of physics." Albert Einstein

You're not much if you're not Dutch. Lorentz entered the University of Leiden in 1870...but after two years went back to his home town in Arnhem – where he taught high school evening classes. Remarkably, he then worked on his doctorate alone on his own while doing the teaching. 

His 1875 PhD thesis was a complete re-thinking of Maxwell's original theory. What Maxwell wrote was incredibly obscure – impossible to read today. I tried years ago... even if one gets past the obscure basis of his model, it's pages and pages for one formula, done over and over again. Just a mammoth mess. Paul Ehrenfest, a friend of Einstein's called it an "intellectual jungle." That's kind. 

While it's easy to dismiss it because of its impenetrability, not since Newton had there been such a new way of trying to describe the physical world and, like Newton, Maxwell had one foot in the past and one foot in a completely uncertain, and novel future. Language and technique were being invented on the fly and one has to wonder that if he'd lived longer, he might have cleaned up his original, extensive work. 

Keep in mind that Maxwell only knew about bulk matter: finite-sized pith balls of charged material. Hunks of iron magnets. Stuff you could hold in your hand. He was only barely able to envision the unity of optics, magnetism, and electricity that he'd birthed, let alone the connection with radiant heat or ultraviolet light or any other form of electromagnetism. 

Maxwell was committed to the ether, but his was a very strange ether: there was an ether of empty space and a separate, but coupled, ether of materials like glass. Matter was not composite, it was bulk and carried its own ether medium.

Lorentz tamed all of this.

On the basis of his thesis – again, remember, self-taught – he was made professor of mathematical physics at Leiden in 1878 and remained there until he retired in 1912. He married Aletta Kaiser, whose father was the Director of (what's now called) the amazing Rijksmuseum. They had two daughters, one of whom became a physicist, and a son. One of his biggest distractions was fending off the dozens of job offers from universities in Europe and the United States. But he stayed. 

### Electrons Were Lorentz's Idea...before there were electrons

Lorentz' original notion was that there was only one ether and there was matter, which was separate but connected in a speculative way. He envisioned that matter consisted of individual charges and that electromagnetic radiation was caused by the acceleration of those charges. He didn't call them "electrons" and didn't have a picture of electrons and protons in atoms – just that some particulate charges inside matter. (The electron was discovered by Thomson in 1897, but the atomic picture wasn't proposed until 1913.) 

Maxwell didn't say any of this, Lorentz did. He further calculated what kind of radiation would occur if a material were in a magnetic field which matched the effect of Sodium vapor which was placed in a **B** field by Peter Zeeman. Zeeman was Lorentz' student and it was a partnership of experiment and explanation that gained them both the Nobel Prize in 1902. We call it the Zeeman Effect (the splitting of atomic spectral lines by a magnetic field) and quantum mechanics become the detailed explanation within the context of atomic theory. 

A part of Lorentz' theory was the calculation that forces that electric charges would experience that we called the Lorentz Force earlier. It's not wrong – and many times it's used – to call electromagnetism the Maxwell-Lorentz equations. 

For Lorentz, the ether was required but there was only one. He replaced Maxwell's complicated substance with that single, fixed ether and the individual charges. Their electromagnetic radiation then propagated i*n the ether* so it coupled ether with matter through those charges. The equations that resulted, with some notational innovations (like vector calculus) added by Helmholtz, became the E&M that's taught to physicists and engineers today. 

Perhaps now you can appreciate how Lorentz' electron theory formed the basis of his treatment of the Michelson-Morley Experimental results. His commitment to electrically charged molecular objects and the realization that forces on them could be affected by motion (Lorentz Force) that it was reasonable to assume that the physical dimensions of Michelson's interferometer's materials would change as they (and their charged constituents) passed through the ether. 

Hence we still call this effect "Lorentz Contraction" and the equations that he figured out that would explain that effect, the "Lorentz Transformations." 

His life which ended at the age of 74 years old in 1928 was celebrated in a huge funeral in Haarlem where he had retired, although while still lecturing at Leiden.

Let's let his son report that day:

>  Never before had there been such a general mourning in the Netherlands at the passing of a theoretical scientist, as there was at my father’s death. I myself saw women from the lower classes in Leyden, as well as men from the upper classes, who were not able to control their emotions.
>
> On the day of the funeral, by instruction of the Postmaster General of the Netherlands, the tele­ graph service throughout the country was closed from twelve noon to 12.03. Thus the funeral of my father became almost a royal homage.
>
> An abstract from the account printed in one of our prominent newspapers will give the readers an impression of the occasion.
>
> “Today Haarlem has buried its great citizen Lorentz and has paid homage to this scholar in a manner both touching and dignified. Already in the early morning an unusual activity was noticeable in the city. Automobiles and carriages travelled back and forth, and it was significant that there was hardly an automobile to be had for those desiring one. From many buildings, such as the Town Hall, the Main Church, the Railway Station and the Cavalery Barracks flags were flown half-mast. In the main streets lanterns draped with crape were burning. Long before the appointed hour thousands and again thousands of people had gathered along the road, while there was great activity about and at the cemetery. 
>
> At the moment that the procession started, the bells of a number of churches, Protestant as well as Roman Catholic, spread their mournful notes of the city. The thousands of people along the road took off their hats in token of deep respect when the procession passed.

There were tributes from around the world, but let's let Einstein speak his piece:

> "For me personally he meant more than all the others I have met on my life’s journey. Just as he mastered physics and mathematical structures, so he mastered also himself, — with ease and perfect serenity. His quite extraordinary lack of human weaknesses never had a depressing influence on his fellow-men. Everyone felt his superiority; no one felt depressed by it. For, although he had a keen insight into human nature and human relationships, he had a charitable kindness towards it all. His influence was never a dominating, but always a serving, helping one. He was exceedingly conscientious, without, however, making any particular matter appear unduly important. From this, he was protected by his fine sense of humour, which reflected itself in his eyes and in his smile."

That smile and those eyes.  

## Lorentz Transformations

Notice that our model for transforming space intervals for our Newtonian sidewalk is like a little computing machine:

* Space in the Away frame - in...space in the Home frame - out.

That's of course what an equation does. A perfect candidate for our fake circuit:

![Galilean_trans](./images/relativity/Galilean_trans.png)

<div class="penout" markdown="1">
🖋 📓
[start highlight]
</div>



Of course what our fake processor is doing is calculating:
$$
\begin{align*}
x_H=&x_A+ut \\
t_H=&t_A=t
\end{align*}
$$
Notice that the time does not change in the Newtonian/Galilean transformation. Nobody had ever imagined that to be different.

Remember that Lorentz preceded Einstein in worrying about Maxwell's equations and the comparisons across co-moving reference frames in in investigating them he came up with a different kind of transformation, which we call the Lorentz Transformations. Einstein derived them from an entirely different approach, without an ether, but the name stuck. These go into our processor the same, but come out differently:

![Lorentz_trans](images/relativity/Lorentz_trans.png)

The Lorentz Transformations (are a "thing" in relativity) are quite different, but familiar in some respects:
$$
\begin{align*}
x_H=&\gamma(x_A+ut_A)\\
t_H=&\gamma(t_A+\dfrac{u}{c^2}x_A)
\end{align*}
$$
Squint at these two equations for a moment. First, remember that if the frame speeds are very low compared with $c$, then
$$
\begin{align*}
\beta =& \frac{u}{c} \xrightarrow{u<<c} 0 \\
\gamma =& \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\left(\dfrac{u}{c}\right)^2}}\xrightarrow{u<<c} 1
\end{align*}
$$
So now look at the first transformation equation: familiar, right? It's just the Newtonian/Galilean transformation. 

<div class="penout" markdown="1">
🖋 📓
[end highlight] </div>

The second transformation is completely different from the Newtonian/Galilean transformation because the time coordinate also changes. But that's not a surprise now that you've enjoyed the Time Dilation experience. But again, with the low frame reference speeds, we get the Newtonian/Galilean transformation back.

Two things happen when we now take the Lorentz Transformations seriously. Remember that Newton's Second law involves space and time variables. If you want to compare a force between co-moving inertial frames of reference you must substitute the space and time variables with the Lorentz-Transformed versions and what you get is: something entirely different.

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">Newton's Second law, <em>F = ma</em> is completely different between two frames: Newton's Second law of motion is <em>not invariant with respect to relative motion</em>.  </p>

What about the other great physical law? Maxwell's Equations? There's a surprise there also:

## Maxwell's Equations, Revisited

Maxwell's equations are differential equations in both space and time. It models how electric and magnetic field vectors (**E** and **B**) change in both space and time. That means that variables $x,y,z$ and $t$ figure prominently in the four equations. Let's use our fake machinery as a metaphor for what it would mean to transform Maxwell's equations between co-moving inertial rest frames.

Let's go back to the airport. Traveler Guy is back to standing on the sidewalk and he's so bored with himself (because he can't motivate himself to walk on the sidewalk like God intended) that he's just admiring a magnet that he's holding. 

![magnet_sidewalk](images/relativity/magnet_sidewalk.png)

We can apply Maxwell's equations to this situation to see what the Couch People would observe. 

![B_transform](images/relativity/B_transform.png)

Look at that again: a pure magnetic field in the Away frame appears to the Home frame to be a mixture of both an electric and a magnetic field.

<p class="pullquote"  markdown="1">Electric and magnetic fields, are completely different between two frames: E & M fields are <em>not invariant with respect to relative motion</em>.  </p>

The two electromagnetic paradoxes of  the last lesson are completely understood as manifestations of the mixing of electric and magnetic fields into one another as viewed from co-moving inertial rest frames. Neither has an independent, permanent existence. Only the combined object, the Electromagnetic Field, is constant.

Think of it this way. Suppose we hold a rectangular block up to a light so its shadow appears on the wall. In some orientation, the shadow will appear elongated or distorted. In some orientation, the shadow will appear rectilinear. The block has not changed, but the shape of the projection of the block on the wall depends on how the block itself is oriented. The block is like the permanent electromagnetic field and the shadows are like the projection of the block, sometimes elongated (say, an electric field)...sometimes, recliner (say, a magnetic field). 

In the end, the 26 year old, the less-than-unknown Albert Einstein showed that:

* Newton's laws of motion need to be modified

* Maxwell's equations are by themselves correct.

##Speeds in Special Relativity

What we've seen so far is that space and time intervals between two relatively moving inertial frames of reference are...unusual. Remember our Weary Traveler on the airport sidewalk, just standing there while the sidewalk moves? He's not taking advantage of the opportunity to get to where he's going faster than if he were walking. That's not what the sidewalk is for!

![airport_v_u](images/relativity/airport_v_u.png)



A more experienced traveler would hop on the moving sidewalk and then walk *on* the moving sidewalk. If one could walk at 2 m/s relative to the sidewalk, and if the sidewalk itself moves at 3 m/s, wouldn't you speed through the airport at 5 m/s?

<div class="penout" markdown="1">
🖋 📓

Let's keep our designation of the relative speed of a reference frame as $u$ and use the symbol $v$ to represent the speed of an object inside of the Away frame. Then that simple, common-sense calculation in the previous paragraph would be
$$
u_H=v_A+u = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ m/s}. (\#eq:galileansidewalk)
$$
But think about what the Home frame observer would see. If there's movement in the Away frame, then speed there would be 
$$
v_A=\frac{\Delta x_A}{\Delta t_A}
$$
But as viewed in the Home frame, both the numerator and the denominator are bound to be different than what Newtonian mechanics would suggest. In that "classical" world-view, the $\Delta t$ term would be the same regardless of what reference frame we're in and just dividing the transformed $x_H = ut + x_A$ by that classical, invariant speed, $\Delta t$ would give Equation XXX above. 

But now we know that not only space transforms but *also time transforms* as determined in two different inertial frames, so our simple $2+3=5$ calculation can't be correct in Relativity.

The actual determination involves calculus and so I'll just tell you the result. You'd expect to see $c$ in there, right? And you'd not be disappointed. 
$$
v_H=\frac{v_A+u}{1+\dfrac{u}{c^2}v_A} (\#eq:Rvelocity)
$$
It looks complicated, but let's do what we always do in a relativistic equation: what does it look like if $u$ is very, very small relative to $c$?

So we get back the Newtonian result as a slow-frame approximation of the relativistic form. 

We can play another game here. What if the moving object in the Away frame is a beam of light? That is, if $v_A=c$?

<!--- limits in velocity transformation--->
<!-- back to normal -------------->

So the Second Postulate falls out of this equation. If $v_A=c$, then $v_H = c$ also. 

Let's divide everything by $c$. We'd get:
$$
\dfrac{v_H}{c} = \frac{\dfrac{v_A}{c} + \beta}{1+\beta \dfrac{v_A}{c}}
$$
This is a relation that's dimensionless and doesn't depend on any particular speed, just how it relates to the speed of light. So let's plot $\dfrac{v_H}{c}$ versus $\dfrac{v_A}{c}$ to see what happens:

![speeds_relative](images/relativity/speeds_relative.png)



So remember, we've got three different velocities going on here. Let's use this plot:

> Suppose we have a frame of reference that's moving at half the speed of light relative to another frame, so $\beta=0.5$. If an object is moving at $0.4c$ in that Away frame, then how fast is it moving in the Home frame?

In the Newtonian picture, you'd have said $0.9c$, right? Here's what that would look like.

![Newtonian_speeds](images/relativity/Newtonian_speeds.png)

However, in relativity, it's a different story and we can use the formula or look at the graph to get that result. From either we'd estimate that it would be  moving at about $0.7c$ or so.

Notice also that the curves for the Relativity speed addition turn over as $u\to c$, while the Newtonian speed addition results are unbounded. That's a hint that the speed of light is a limiting velocity. More about this in a bit.

### Interstellar Space Travel

The closest solar system to ours is near the star Alpha Centauri a little more than 4 light years from Earth. 

> Remember that a "light year" (aka ly) is the distance that light would travel in one year. It's: 

$$
\begin{align*}
\text{From: } x =& vt \\
1 \text{ LY} =& c \times 1 \text{ year} \\
=& 9.4607\times 10^{15} \text{ m} = 9.4607\times 10^{12} \text{ km} \\
=& 5.8786 \times 10^{12} \text{ mi}
\end{align*}
$$

> It's a hike.

In the sky, near the Southern Cross, is a tiny red dwarf star, Proxima Centauri, which is 4.23 light years from us. It has a planet that is about 1.2 times the mass of Earth, Proxima Centauri b, which is in the habitable zone of its star. That means that liquid water could exist on "Planet b."

![centauri](images/relativity/centauri.png){ width=95% }<figcaption>Alpha Centauri is a naked eye object, but Proxima Centauri is not.</figcaption>

At this writing, in 2021, 4 years ago means that for any of the TV-watching residents on Planet b, Will has just disappeared from the quiet town of Hawkins in *Stranger Things* since it took four years for that first episode to travel from, Earth to Proxima.

How might humans get there? I'd refer to the great science fiction novel, *Tau Zero*, by Poul Anderson. It's a great story and full of relativity. The "tau" refers to the proper time, which remember we represent as $\tau$ rather than $t$. Remember, that's the special time that's inside of a Home reference frame. It's the time <u>you</u> see on <u>your</u> watch. In the story, space travelers have propulsion sufficient to power their craft at a constant acceleration of $g$, so on board, it seems like Earth gravity. That's an enormous acceleration and it's not clear how that could ever be achieved given the fuel required. But let's run with it. Or rather, fly with it for fun. 

Remember that Newton would have said that the speed that a spacecraft would achieve at a constant acceleration of $1g$ would be
$$
v=gt \nonumber
$$
Simple, right? The relativistic version of this is a little more complicated and I'll not solve it for you algebraically, but I'll "solve" it for you as a graph. The easiest way to show this is not a specific speed, but plotting $\beta =v/c$ as a function of time, in this case, days of acceleration.

![oneg](images/relativity/oneg.png)

Newton's acceleration just increases without bound, but look at what happens in a relativistic world: the speed is limited to always be less than the speed of light. In the first half a year or so, the Newtonian and relativistic speeds would be pretty much the same, but then they start to separate. After a year of this acceleration, the (real, relativity-observing) spacecraft would be traveling at about 75% of the speed of light, while the Newtonian speed would just be crossing the speed of light on to faster and faster, fictitious(!) velocities. 

What does this mean for a trip to Proxima Centauri? Here again, the mathematics is formidable so I'll just show you the results of my calculation. We need a strategy since we don't want to be constantly speeding up...we have to slow down to arrive! So here's the flight plan:

* We'll accelerate at $g$ for two light years,
* cruise at whatever speed that takes us to for 0.2 light years, and
* then we'll decelerate at $-g$ for two light years. 

![proxima_trip](images/relativity/proxima_trip.png)

The top speed as viewed from the Earth is $0.9453c$ which is also the speed that the Earth is moving away from the spacecraft. 

![proxima_graph](images/relativity/proxima_graph.png)

Some fun facts about this trip:

* acceleration time, relative to Earth = 2.8 years 
* acceleration time, relative to ship = 1.7295 years
* whole trip time, relative to Earth = 5.8695 years
* whole trip time, relative to ship = 3.5428 years

The graph above is from the perspective of the spacecraft. This is a graphic (no pun intended) picture of Time Dilation for a "modest" trip within our neighborhood.

Let's do it one more time. Think Star Trek. Trappist-1 is a dwarf star that's 40 ly from Earth. Let's go there with the same propulsion system and a similar flight plan:

* We'll accelerate at $g$ for nine light years,
* cruise at whatever speed that takes us to for 22 light years, and
* then we'll decelerate at $-g$ for nine light years. 

Here's how that would go. Changing lives and families, both on-board and on Earth.

* acceleration time, relative to Earth = 9.9 years 
* top speed, relative to Earth = 0.9953 c
* acceleration time, relative to ship = 2.97 years
* whole trip time, relative to Earth = 41.9 years
* whole trip time, relative to ship = 8 years

> You might be wondering about this accelerating frame of reference and whether Special Relativity can handle that? That's a tricky thing and involves the mathematical feature of a frame being "inertial" instantaneously. At each step along the way, the speed of the frame is increasing, but at each step, that frame can be considered inertial. In General Relativity, which we'll deal with in a bit, all frames are relative, while in Special Relativity, ostensibly only inertial frames are relative. The big difference here is that our rocket travels at a constant acceleration, which is more restrictive than a General Relativity perspective where everything is relative. Sorry. This is one of those things that's pretty deeply embedded in mathematics that we're not going to dig into in QS&BB. 

### Inertia?

Look back at the previous two figures. The relativistic increase of speed with time is not linear like it would be for Newtonian dynamics. Think about this. We're applying a constant force but not getting back a constant speed. We go faster, but at a slower rate. It's as if we're moving through an increasingly resistive medium...like cement that gets more and more dense as we go. 

Suppose we're walking along and as we go someone is adding weight to our backpack. The more massive we get, the harder it is to maintain our speed. What's happening is that just from a simple-minded $F=ma$: *our inertia appears to be increasing*. 

Those curves are a hint that something like the inertia of the spacecraft is increasing, the faster we go. What's the measure of inertia? <u>Mass</u>.

Time for the T-shirt equation.
